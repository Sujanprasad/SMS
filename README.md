DBMS Mini project 

STUDENT DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Abstract
The Student Database Management System (DBMS) is a comprehensive web-based mini project developed using Python Flask and SQLite. It demonstrates database handling, relational joins, and CRUD operations across Students, Courses, and Enrollments modules. Flask provides the backend routes, SQLite stores data, and Bootstrap ensures a modern responsive interface. The project showcases complete integration of backend logic, frontend design, and relational database management within a single cohesive application.
Technology Stack
• Backend: Python (Flask Framework)
• Database: SQLite
• Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5
• Development Environment: Visual Studio Code
• Languages Used: Python, SQL, HTML, CSS
System Overview
The system includes:
1. Students Module – Manages student details (name, age, department).
2. Courses Module – Stores courses and credits.
3. Enrollments Module – Links students with courses using foreign keys.

These modules demonstrate CRUD operations and relational joins in an educational context.
Database Design
The database for the Student Database Management System consists of three main tables:
Students, Courses, and Enrollments.
•	The Students table stores essential student details such as ID, name, and email.
•	The Courses table holds course-related data including course name and credits.
•	The Enrollments table acts as a bridge between students and courses, linking them through foreign keys to record which student is enrolled in which course.
These relationships are maintained using primary and foreign keys, ensuring data consistency and referential integrity throughout the system.

Conclusion & Future Scope
The Student Database Management System demonstrates full-stack development using Flask and SQLite. It showcases CRUD operations, database relationships, and integration of a responsive frontend. This project provided practical exposure to Python web frameworks and database design principles. Future improvements could include authentication, analytics, and export functionalities.
